# What is VirtualBox?

VirtualBox is a Type 2 hypervisor. It is open-source, cross-platform, and high performance in nature. It was formerly developed by Sun Microsystems as Sun VirtualBox and now it's an Oracle product freely available as open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License \(GNU GPL\) Version 2 licensing. As this is cross-platform, it can run on any modern desktop operating system whether it is Linux, Windows, Mac, or Solaris.

Apart from the fact that VirtualBox is efficient, robust, cross-platform, and high performance in nature, it is also free, which makes this product compelling. Also, it is the only open-source hypervisor of its kind.

It has many components, such as a hypervisor for the host platform, an API and SDK for managing guest virtual machines, and a command-line tool and GUI that can manage VM guests and some built-in features such as Remote Desktop Protocol \(RDP\) that can access guest VMs remotely and graphical tools that can manage VM guests as well.
